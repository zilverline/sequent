-- This script migrates a pre-sequent 8 database to the sequent 8 schema while preserving the data.
-- It runs in a single transaction and when completed you can COMMIT or ROLLBACK the results.
--
-- To adjust the partitioning setup you can modify `./sequent_schema_partitions.sql`. By default
-- only a single partition is present for each partitioned table, which works well for smaller
-- (e.g. less than 10 Gigabytes) databases.
--
-- Ensure you test this on a copy of your production system to verify everything works and to
-- get an indication of the required downtime for your system.
