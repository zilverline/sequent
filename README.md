[![sequent Actions Status](https://github.com/zilverline/sequent/workflows/rspec/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zilverline/sequent/actions) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/zilverline/sequent/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/zilverline/sequent) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/zilverline/sequent/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/zilverline/sequent)

> Sequent is a CQRS and event sourcing framework written in Ruby.

## Getting started

See the official site at https://www.sequent.io/

New to Sequent? [Getting Started](http://www.sequent.io/docs/getting-started.html) is the place to be!

## Contributing

Fork and send pull requests. You can setup a working development environment manually (see below) or by using https://devenv.sh with Nix. You can also
use https://direnv.net/ do setup your environment automatically, see `.envrc.example` for the minimal configuration.

Then just run `devenv up` to start Postgres and Jekyll. Run `devenv test` to (re-)create the databases and run the specs.

## Documentation

See the official site at https://sequent.io/

Want to help improve the documentation? Please let us know how we can improve by [creating an issue](https://github.com/zilverline/sequent/issues/new)

If you want to help write the documentation fork and send pull request.

You can start the documentation locally via:

```
cd docs
bundle install
cp .env.example .env
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

A GitHub personal access token is required if you want Jekyll to retrieve GitHub metadata information.
[Create a new personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (no scope is required) and configure it in the .env file.

## Releasing

Ensure the version in `lib/version.rb` is the new version. If not change it and update the sequent version for all the `gemfiles`:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_7_1.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_7_2.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_8_0.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
```

Commit the changes.

Then run `rake release`. A git tag will be created and pushed, and the new version of the gem will be pushed to rubygems.


## Running the specs

### Database setup
* When using a local PostgreSQL database, create the user:
  ```shell
  createuser -D -s -R sequent
  ```
* If you're not using a local Postgres database, setup the database using docker:
  ```shell
  docker run --name sequent -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -e POSTGRES_USER=sequent -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
  ```

### Create the database
Have Sequent create the database:
```shell
SEQUENT_ENV=test bundle exec rake sequent:db:create
```

Run `rspec spec` to run the tests with the current database schema.

To ensure the specs use the latest database schema run:

```
SEQUENT_ENV=test rake sequent:db:drop sequent:db:create spec
```
