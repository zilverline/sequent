## Releasing

Ensure the version in `lib/version.rb` is the new version. If not change it and commit this change.

Then run `rake release`. A git tag will be created and pushed, and the new version of the gem will be pushed to rubygems.

Increase version to new working version, update the sequent version for all the `gemfiles`: 

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_6_0.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_6_1.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_7_0.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_7_1.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/ar_7_2.gemfile bundle update sequent --conservative
```

## Running the specs

### Database setup
* When using a local PostgreSQL database, create the user:
  ```shell
  createuser -D -s -R sequent
  ```
* If you're not using a local Postgres database, setup the database using docker:
  ```shell
  docker run --name sequent -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -e POSTGRES_USER=sequent -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
  ```

### Create the database
Have Sequent create the database:
```shell
SEQUENT_ENV=test bundle exec rake sequent:db:create
```

Run `rspec spec` to run the tests.
