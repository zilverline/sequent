    # EventHandlers listen to events and handle them according to their responsibility.
    #
    # Examples:
    # * Updating view states
    # * Sending emails
    # * Executing other commands based on events (chainging)
    #
    # Example of updating view state, in this case the InvoiceRecord table representing an Invoice
    #
    #   class InvoiceCommandHandler < Sequent::Core::BaseCommandHandler
    #     on CreateInvoiceCommand do |command|
    #       create_record(
    #         InvoiceRecord,
    #         recipient: command.recipient,
    #         amount: command.amount
    #       )
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Please note that the actual storage is abstracted away in the +record_session+. Reason
    # is when replaying the entire event_store our default choice, active_record, is too slow.
    # Also we want to give the opportunity to use other storage mechanisms for the view state.
    # See the +def_delegators+ which method to implement.
    # Due to this abstraction you can not traverse into child objects when using ActiveRecord
    # like you are used to:
    #
    #   invoice_record.line_item_records << create_record(LineItemRecord, ...)
    #
    # In this case you should simply do:
    #
    #   create_record(LineItemRecord, invoice_id: invoice_record.aggregate_id)
    #
