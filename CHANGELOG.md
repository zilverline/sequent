# Upgrading to 3.0 from 2.0

The most notable changes are:

## Addition of more sophisticated way of replaying. See the docs on how to configure.

## Dropped support for AR < 5.0

## Deprecated MigrateEvents as strategy for event migration

## Renamed Sequent::Core::BaseEventHandler to Sequent::Core::Projector

## Renamed Sequent::Core::Sessions::ActiveRecordSession to Sequent::Core::Persistors::ActiveRecordPersistor

## Renamed Sequent::Core::Sessions::ReplayEventsSession to Sequent::Core::Persistors::ReplayOptimzedPostgresPersistor


# Upgrading to 2.0 from 1.0

The most notable changes are:

##  Addition of the queue-based command and event handling.

To illustrate the difference see example below:

```ruby
# command c1 results in event e1
on c1 do
  apply e1
end

# workflow: event e1 results in new command c3
on e1 do
  execute_commands(c3)
end

# main
execute_commands(c1, c2)
```

Prior to version 1.1 the order is as follows:
- `c1`
- `c3`
- `c2`
- `e1`

As you can see command `c3` is executed before `c2` although `c2` was scheduled before `c3`.

As of version 1.1 the order will be:
- `c1`
- `c2`
- `c3`
- `e1`


Commands and events are added to the queues as they occur and than handled in that order. If you have
never had workflows scheduling new commands in the foreground nothing changes. If you have used workflows
in the foreground the order will be different, so ensure your system still behaves correctly.

The `Sequent::Core::EventStore::PublishEventError` is renamed to `Sequent::Core::EventPublisher::PublishEventError`

## Global sequent config
Another possible breaking change is the way the config is setup. The sequent config now global, so some sequent classes
in the config do not take parameters anymore. You will need to change your sequent config, and will have affect
on your tests.
Please see [the docs](https://github.com/zilverline/sequent/blob/master/README.md) and the [example apps](https://github.com/zilverline/sequent-examples) for more information.
