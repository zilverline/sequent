title: Configuration
---

When generating a new Sequent project the configuration can be found in `config/initializers/sequent.rb`.
You are free to determine your own location as long as you require the file at startup of your application.

There are many configuration options, but generally sticking to the defaults should be sufficient. With that thought in
mind this chapter is divided into 3 sections:

1. The [minimum configuration](#minimum-configuration) you need
2. [Configuration options](#frequently-used-configuration) you will likely want to change
3. The [complete overview](#complete-configuration) of options. Basically the rest.

## Minimum configuration

As a bare minimum you need:

```ruby
require './db/migrations'

Sequent.configure do |config|
  # sequent >= 6.0.2
  config.enable_autoregistration = true

  # sequent < 6.0.2
  config.command_handlers = [
    YourCommandHandler.new,
    OtherCommandHandler.new,
  ]

  config.event_handlers = [
    MyProjector.new,
    MyWorkflow.new,
  ]
  # end sequent < 6.0.2

end
```

The `migrations_class` is the class used to define your Migrations. See the [Migrations](migrations.html) chapter for an
in-depth explanation.

### Autoregistration
Sequent 6.0.2 introduced autoregistration of `command_handlers` and `event_handlers` via
setting `enable_autoregistration` to `true`.
Autoregistered classes will be appended to any already manually registered `command_handlers` and `event_handlers`. If
Sequent detects duplicates it will currently fail.
When setting `enable_autoregistration` to `true` in your `initializer`
any [CommandHandlers](command-handler.html), [Projectors](projector.html) and [Workflows](workflow.html) are
automatically registered in your Sequent configuration.
When you have base classes that you don't want to have automatically registered you can
set `self.abstract_class = true` for these classes. Another option to skip autoregistration is to set
`self.skip_autoregister` to `true`.

## Frequently used configuration:

```ruby
Sequent.configure do |config|
  # minimum config omitted

  # common config options
  config.command_filters = [
    MyFilter.new,
  ]

  config.number_of_replay_processes = 4

  config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
end
```

### CommandFilters

CommandFilters can be used to enforce certain criteria are met before executing commands. Typical
concerns are authorization in a user based application. A filter must implement the method `execute(command)`.
If any of the CommandFilters raises an Exception, execution is aborted for all passed [Commands](command.html).

Example

```ruby

class AdminFilter
  def execute(command)
    fail NotAnAdmin unless is_allowed?(command.user_id, command.class)
  end

  # only admin may execute admin commands
  def is_allowed?(user_id, command_class)
    return false if !UserRecord.is_admin?(user_id) && command_class <= AdminCommand
    return true
  end
end

Sequent.configure do |config|
  config.command_filters = [
    AdminFilter.new,
  ]
end
```

### number_of_replay_processes

The number of processes used to replay the events when doing a [Migration](migration.html). By default this is 4.
This should be adjusted to the capacity of your server running the Migration.

### logger

The ruby Logger used by Sequent.
