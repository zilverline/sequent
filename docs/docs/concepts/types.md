title: Types
---

In Sequent events are stored as JSON in the event store. To be able to serialize and deserialize to the correct
types you are required to specify the type of an attribute.

This also gives Sequent the possibility to check if the attributes
in for instance the [Commands](command.html) and [ValueObject](value-object.html) are of the correct type.

Before a Command is executed the [CommandService](command-service.html) ensures
that the attributes are validated and parsed to the correct types if necessary.

Out of the box Sequent supports the following types:

1. [String](#string)
1. [Integer](#integer)
1. [Date](#date)
1. [DateTime](#datetime)
1. [Time](#time)
1. [Boolean](#boolean)
1. [Symbol](#symbol)
1. [ValueObjects](#valueobjects)
1. [Lists](#lists)
1. [Sequent::Secret](#sequentsecret)
1. [BigDecimal](#bigdecimal)


### String

Usage: `attrs name: String`

Valid strings are `nil` and anything that can be `to_s`-ed.
There are some invalid characters like `"\0000"` postgres can't handle.

When a String is considered invalid the error code `invalid_string` is
added to the attribute in the ActiveModels `Errors` object during [validation](validations.html).

### Integer

Usage `attrs counter: Integer`

Registers the following Validation:

```
validates_numericality_of :counter, only_integer: true, allow_nil: true, allow_blank: true
```

To accommodate user input Integers passed as Strings
are parsed automatically when a Command is passed to the CommandService.

### Date:

Usage `attrs created_at: Date`

Accepts all `Date` objects. To accommodate user input valid
iso8601 date Strings are parsed automatically when
a Command is passed to the [CommandService](command-service.html).

## DateTime

**DEPRECATED** Use `Time` instead

Usage `attrs created_at: DateTime`

Accepts all `DateTime` objects. To accommodate user input valid
iso8601 datetime Strings are parsed automatically when
a Command is passed to the CommandService.

## Time

Usage `attrs created_at: Time`

Accepts all `Time` objects. To accommodate user input valid
iso8601 datetime Strings are parsed automatically when
a Command is passed to the CommandService.

## Boolean:

Usage `attrs confirmed: Boolean`

Valid Booleans are `true` `false` and `nil`. To accommodate user input
the values `"true"` and `"false"` are parsed to `true` and `false`
automatically when a Command is passed to the CommandService.

## Symbol:

Usage `attrs user_type: Symbol`

## ValueObjects

Usage: `attrs address: Address`

Custom [ValueObjects](value-object.html) can contain other ValueObjects
of `attrs` of the Types described here.

## Lists

Usage: `attrs names: array(String)`

Lists can be List or any Type described here.

## Sequent::Secret

Usage: `attrs password: Sequent::Secret`

This is a special type designed to work with user input (HTML forms).

It will irreversibly hash the attribute that is of type `Sequent::Secret` using bcrypt.

You can use this type as follows:

```ruby
class CreateUser < Sequent::Command
  validates_presence_of :email, :password

  attrs email: String, password: Sequent::Secret
end

post '/create' do
  create_user = CreateUser.new(
    aggregate_id: Sequent.new_uuid,
    email: params[:email],
    password: params[:password],
  )

  Sequent.command_service.execute_commands create_user
end

class UserCommandHandler < Sequent::CommandHandler
  on CreateUser do |command|
    # 1. password is now of type Sequent::Secret
    # 2. the password is encrypted

  end
end
```

**There is no need to use this in Events since those should always contain the hashed secret.**
Events can store these values in plain Strings

## BigDecimal

Usage: `attrs amount: BigDecimal`

Ruby's BigDecimal. **No special validations are added by default.** The value is passed to `BigDecimal.new(value)` as is.
