title: Validations
---

Sequent uses [ActiveModel::Validations](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html)
for validating things like [Commands](command.html) and [ValueObjects](value-object.html).

For an in depth explanation of AvtiveModel validations please checkout their website.

Sequent already adds validations checking if the attribute is of the correct type for the default [Types](types.html).
