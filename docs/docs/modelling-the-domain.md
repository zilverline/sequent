The app we generated in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.html) comes with an example `Post` aggregate. In this guide we will take a
quick look at Sequent's directory structure, go over some of the concepts used in Sequent by expanding on `Post`, and
create our very own `Author` aggregate.

## Example `Post` aggregate

### Directory structure

Let's have a look at the general directory structure of a generated Sequent project. If something doesn't make sense
right away, bear with us because we will walk through these folders one by one in the rest of this article.

```bash
app/           # Non-domain application logic
  projectors/  # Subscribe to events and write to records
  records/     # Ephemeral view tables (ActiveRecord models)
config/        # Configurations to glue everything together
db/            # Database management and configuration
lib/           # Contains your domain logic
spec/          # Tests for your application
```

Zooming in on the `lib` folder reveals the domain and most important concepts of the app:

```bash
post/                      # Files are grouped by aggregate root
  commands.rb              # All post commands go here
  events.rb                # All post events go here
  post_command_handler.rb  # Subscribes to post commands and dispatches post events
  post.rb                  # The aggregate root
post.rb                    # Requires the entire aggregate root
```

### Commands

Changes to state start by executing a command. Commands are quite simple classes containing some attributes and
attribute validations. Looking at `lib/post/commands.rb`, we have one command:

```ruby
class AddPost < Sequent::Command
  attrs author: String, title: String, content: String
  validates_presence_of :author, :title, :content
end
```

_Learn all about commands in the [Command](/docs/concepts/command.html) Reference Guide._
{: .notice}

### Handling commands

The `PostCommandHandler` in `lib/post/post_command_handler.rb` subscribes to `Post` commands and calls the domain (i.e.
the `Post` aggregate root). We can see this happening for `AddPost`:

```ruby
class PostCommandHandler < Sequent::CommandHandler
  on AddPost do |command|
    repository.add_aggregate Post.new(command)
  end
end
```

Because we are adding a new aggregate, `add_aggregate` is called with `Post.new(command)` as its argument. The actual
business logic of what `Post` looks like is contained in the aggregate root, which we'll look at in the next paragraph.

You are free to define your own signature of the constructor. In the example we chose to pass the command as argument,
but nothing prevents you to define it using the separate attributes.

### Aggregate Root

In `lib/post/post.rb` we find the aggregate root. This class encapsulates your business logic. Events are applied to
instances of `Post` to give it its current state. We can see here that creation of a new `Post` will apply multiple
events. Besides `PostAdded` we're also applying events to change the author, title and content. You might be tempted to
group all those fields in one event, which can be a good idea if those fields always change together. We're using
multiple events to emphasise that a single command does not always correlate to a single event.

```ruby
class Post < Sequent::AggregateRoot
  def initialize(command)
    super(command.aggregate_id)
    apply PostAdded
    apply PostAuthorChanged, author: command.author
    apply PostTitleChanged, title: command.title
    apply PostContentChanged, content: command.content
  end

  # ...
end
```

_Learn all about aggregate roots in the [AggregateRoot](/docs/concepts/aggregate-root.html) Reference Guide._
{: .notice}

### Events

In `lib/post/events.rb` we have the events defined which are used in the aggregate root:

```ruby
class PostAdded < Sequent::Event
end

class PostAuthorChanged < Sequent::Event
  attrs author: String
end

class PostTitleChanged < Sequent::Event
  attrs title: String
end

class PostContentChanged < Sequent::Event
  attrs content: String
end

```

Events contain all the state changes on an AggregateRoot. These events are stored in the database in the `event_records`
table as JSON.

## Publishing a Post

We have now gone through the generated example files.

Lets expand Post by adding functionality to take our `Post` from draft to published.

### Test setup

Add the following test case to the `PostCommandHandler` tests in `spec/lib/post/post_command_handler_spec.rb`:

```ruby
  it 'publishes a post' do
    given_events PostAdded.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1)

    when_command PublishPost.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, publication_date: Date.current.to_s)
    then_events(
      PostPublished.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1, publication_date: Date.current.to_s)
    )
  end
```

This test will fail as our code is missing the `PublishPost` command, `PostPublished` event and the command handling in
`PostCommandHandler`.

### Publish Post command

Let's add a `PublishPost` command, the command will look like this:

```ruby
class PublishPost < Sequent::Command
  attrs publication_date: DateTime
  validates_presence_of :publication_date
end
```

We only need the `publication_date` attribute. Commands always target an aggregate, so we already know what to change by
its `aggregate_id`. We could set a `publish` flag, but the event already communicates this intent.

### Handling publish Post command

We add our own `on` block below the `AddPost` block in `lib/post/post_command_handler.rb` to handle the `PublishPost`
command:

```ruby
on PublishPost do |command|
  do_with_aggregate(command, Post) do |post|
    post.publish(command.publication_date)
  end
end
```

Sequent retrieves the post for us and we call the (to be defined) `publish` method on the returned `Post` instance.

### Post aggregate Root

Let's define how the domain should behave when receiving our new `PublishPost` command. In `lib/post/post.rb`, below the
initialize method add:

```ruby
class PostAlreadyPublishedError < StandardError; end

def publish(publication_date)
  fail PostAlreadyPublishedError if @publication_date.present?

  apply PostPublished, publication_date: publication_date
end
```

In Sequent you execute / enforce your business rules in these methods **before** applying events.

### Post published event

In `lib/post/post.rb` we just applied the `PostPublished` event. We need to define this event in `lib/post/events.rb`,
add the following:

```ruby
class PostPublished < Sequent::Event
  attrs publication_date: Date
end
```

### Handling event

Back in the aggregate root, we handle the `PostPublished` event. Add the following to the class `Post` in lib/post/post.rb`:

```ruby
on PostPublished do |event|
  @publication_date = event.publication_date
end
```

With this latest change, the test case in `post_command_handler_spec.rb` will succeed. The domain is now able to handle
post publishing.


## Adding an Author

In this guide, we will 'upgrade' `Author` to its own Aggregate Root. This means we need to add new files defining the
`Author` Aggregate Root, and make some changes to the `Post` commands and events, i.e. using the author `aggregate_id`
instead of an author String.

### Test setup

Create `spec/lib/author/author_command_handler_spec.rb` with:

```ruby
require_relative '../../spec_helper'
require_relative '../../../lib/author'

describe AuthorCommandHandler do
  before :each do
    Sequent.configuration.command_handlers = [AuthorCommandHandler.new]
  end

  context AddAuthor do
    it 'creates a user when valid input'
    it 'fails if the username already exists'
    it 'ignores case in usernames'
  end
end
```

There might be more edge cases but for now this is sufficient.

### General setup

Let's create the necessary classes in order to get the test to 'green'.

We will stick to Sequent's suggested directory structure, so we will end up with something like this:

```bash
blog.rb
lib/           # Contains your domain logic
  author.rb    # Requires all author/*.rb
  author/      # Contains the author related domain classes
    author.rb
    events.rb
    commands.rb
    author_command_handler.rb
```

#### Author aggregate root

Create the basic code by running `sequent generate aggregate author`. Now `lib/author/author.rb` has:

```ruby
class Author < Sequent::AggregateRoot
  def initialize(command)
    super(command.aggregate_id)
    apply AuthorAdded
  end

  on AuthorAdded do
  end
end
```

#### Author command

Let's update the `AddAuthor` with some useful attributes. Update `lib/author/commands.rb` to:

```ruby
class AddAuthor < Sequent::Command
  attrs name: String, email: String
  validates_presence_of :name, :email
end
```

#### Author command handler

The `lib/author/author_command_handler.rb` is already generated to instantiate and save the author
on the `AddAuthor` command:

```ruby
class AuthorCommandHandler < Sequent::CommandHandler
  on AddAuthor do |command|
    repository.add_aggregate Author.new(command)
  end
end
```

Require the new `Author` aggregate by adding the following to `blog.rb`:
```ruby
require_relative 'lib/author'
```

### Author command handler

When we run the tests in `spec/lib/author/author_command_handler_spec.rb`, all are marked as `Pending: Not yet
implemented`. Before we can go any further, we need to think about what kind of Events we are interested in.  What
do we want to know in this case? When registering our very first `Author`, it create the Author, and it's unique
keys will ensure uniqueness of the usernames.

The test will read something like:
```
When i add an Author for the first time
Then the Author is created with the given name and email
```

By leveraging Sequent's test DSL we can modify the test we have created for this in
`spec/lib/author/author_command_handler_spec.rb` as follows:

```ruby
context AddAuthor do
  let(:user_aggregate_id) { Sequent.new_uuid }
  let(:email) { 'ben@sequent.io' }

  it 'creates a user when valid input' do
    when_command AddAuthor.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, name: 'Ben', email: email)
    then_events AuthorAdded.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1, name: 'Ben', email: email),
                AuthorNameSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 2, name: 'Ben'),
                AuthorEmailSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, email: 'ben@sequent.io', sequence_number: 3)
  end
  it 'fails if the username already exists'
  it 'ignores case in usernames'
end
```

In Sequent (or other event sourcing libraries) you test your code by checking the applied events, and which order they
were run in. In this case we modelled the `AuthorNameSet` and `AuthorEmailSet` as separate events, since they probably
don't change together.

In more comprehensive cases we can imagine triggering other events, e.g. when the email changes, a confirmation is sent.
You should take these considerations into account when modelling your domain and defining your Events.

Let's create the necessary code to make the test pass.

#### Author events

Create `lib/author/events.rb` with:
```ruby
class AuthorAdded < Sequent::Event
end

class AuthorNameSet < Sequent::Event
  attrs name: String
end

class AuthorEmailSet < Sequent::Event
  attrs email: String
end
```

#### Update Author aggregate root

Update `lib/author/author.rb` to:

```ruby
class Author < Sequent::AggregateRoot
  def initialize(command)
    super(command.aggregate_id)
    apply AuthorAdded
    apply AuthorNameSet, name: command.name
    apply AuthorEmailSet, email: command.email
  end
end
```

Also add an `AuthorEmailSet` event handler to store the email:

```ruby
  on AuthorEmailSet do |event|
    @email = event.email
  end
```

The [Author command handler test](#author-command-handler) will now pass.

### Author email constraint

For the next test case we want to assert the following:

```
Given an Author with email 'ben@sequent.io'
When I try to add another author with email 'ben@sequent.io'
Then it should fail
```

Replace the matching test case in `spec/lib/author/author_command_handler_spec.rb` to:

```ruby
it 'fails if the username already exists' do
  given_events AuthorAdded.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1),
               AuthorNameSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 2, name: 'Ben'),
               AuthorEmailSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 3, email: 'ben@sequent.io')
  expect {
    when_command AddAuthor.new(
                   aggregate_id: Sequent.new_uuid,
                   name: 'kim',
                   email: 'ben@sequent.io'
                 )
  }.to raise_error Sequent::Core::AggregateKeyNotUniqueError
end
```

When we run this spec we get the following error message:

```text
expected Sequent::Core::AggregateKeyNotUniqueError but nothing was raised
```

This is as expected, since we haven't told Sequent about this unique
constraint yet. So to enforce uniqueness of the author's username
define it as a unique key on the `Author` aggregate by adding the
following declarations to the `Author`:

```ruby
attr_reader :email
unique_key :author_email, :email
```

The test case now passes successfully.


### Author email case insensitive

Replace the matching test case in `spec/lib/author/author_command_handler_spec.rb` to:

```ruby
it 'ignores case in usernames' do
  given_events AuthorAdded.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1),
               AuthorNameSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 2, name: 'Ben'),
               AuthorEmailSet.new(aggregate_id: user_aggregate_id, sequence_number: 3, email: 'ben@sequent.io')
  expect {
    when_command AddAuthor.new(
                   aggregate_id: Sequent.new_uuid,
                   name: 'kim',
                   email: 'BeN@SeQuEnT.io'
                 )
  }.to raise_error Sequent::Core::AggregateKeyNotUniqueError
end
```

Now we need to pass a block to the unique key declaration so that the
email is normalized before being checked for uniqueness:

```ruby
unique_key :user_email, email: -> { email&.downcase }
```

### Adding a Post using the new Author Aggregate Root

The last thing we need to do to successfully add a post, is refactor out `Author` name, and instead use the `Author`
`aggregate_id`. This requires a few changes.

1. Change the passed command values and event attributes in test of `PostCommandHandler` in `spec/lib/post/post_command_handler_spec.rb`:
```ruby
let(:aggregate_id) { Sequent.new_uuid }
let(:author_aggregate_id) { Sequent.new_uuid }
```
```ruby
it 'creates a post' do
  when_command AddPost.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, author_aggregate_id: author_aggregate_id, title: 'My first blogpost', content: 'Hello World!')
  then_events(
      PostAdded.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, sequence_number: 1),
      PostAuthorChanged.new(aggregate_id: aggregate_id, sequence_number: 2, author_aggregate_id: author_aggregate_id),
      PostTitleChanged,
      PostContentChanged
  )
end
```

1. Update the attribute presence validation of `AddPost` in `lib/post/commands.rb`:
```ruby
class AddPost < Sequent::Command
  attrs author_aggregate_id: String, title: String, content: String
  validates_presence_of :author_aggregate_id, :title, :content
end
```

1. Update the `initialize` method and `on PostAuthorChanged` handler in `lib/post/post.rb`
```ruby
def initialize(command)
  super(command.aggregate_id)
  apply PostAdded
  apply PostAuthorChanged, author_aggregate_id: command.author_aggregate_id
  apply PostTitleChanged, title: command.title
  apply PostContentChanged, content: command.content
end
```
```ruby
on PostAuthorChanged do |event|
  @author_aggregate_id = event.author_aggregate_id
end
```

1. Update the `PostAuthorChanged` event in `lib/post/events.rb`
```ruby
class PostAuthorChanged < Sequent::Event
  attrs author_aggregate_id: String
end
```
When running the tests, they should now all pass.


## Summary

In this guide we:

1. Explored the generated `Post` AggregateRoot.
2. Added new functionality to publish a `Post`.
3. Added a new Aggregate `Author` and showed how Aggregates can depend on each other.
4. Explored how to add tests in Sequent in order to test the domain.

In this guide we mainly focussed on the domain. In the [next guide](/docs/building-a-web-application.html) we will take
it a step further and see how can actually build a web application that our Authors can use. We will learn how to
initialize and set up Sequent with Sinatra, learn about [Projectors](/docs/concepts/projector.html) and see how Sequent
deals with migrations.
