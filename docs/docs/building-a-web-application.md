title: Building a web application with Sequent
---

## Tying it all together

The app we generated in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.html) and expanded in [Modelling the Domain](/docs/modelling-the-domain.html) is now ready to be used by real Authors via the Web.
Sequent is no webframework and can be used with any webframework you want. For this guide we choose Sinatra.
