Sequent is a CQRS and event sourcing framework (ES) written in Ruby. This site is intended
to help you learn and develop CQRS / ES applications in Ruby (using Sequent).
Sequent **focusses** on the **domain logic** of your application. It is web framework agnostic.
You can use it with Rails, Sinatra or whatever framework you like.

There are several guides available

## Getting Started

New to Sequent? [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.html) is the place to start.

## Concepts

### AggregateRoot

An [AggregateRoot](/docs/concepts/aggregate-root.html) is the class that encapsulates your domain logic. Your aggregates form the heart of your application.

### Event

[Events](/docs/concepts/event.html) are domain events that are significant to your domain. An AggregateRoot is basically a stream of Events.

### Command

[Commands](/docs/concepts/command.html) form the API of your domain. They are simple data objects
with descriptive names describing the intent of your command. E.g. `SendInvoice`.

### CommandHandler

Commands are handled by [CommandHandlers](/docs/concepts/command-handler.html). Based on the incoming Command the CommandHandler decides what to do.

### Projector

[Projectors](/docs/concepts/projector.html) listen to Events. They are responsible for update the Projections in the view schema.

### Workflow

[Workflows](/docs/concepts/workflow.html) also listen to Events. They are typically used for anything else you want to do with events. (E.g. execute another command).

### AggregateRepository

The [AggregateRepository](/docs/concepts/aggregate-repository.html) is the interface to the event store. Use this object to load and store AggregateRoots.

### CommandService

The [CommandService](/docs/concepts/command-service.html) is the interface for executing commands. The CommandService will than call you CommandHandlers in order to get things done.
